This set of files is for generating:

A parm file stripped of ions and water.
A coordinate file (saved as .rst7) stripped of ions of water.
A stripped trajectory (saved as netcdf, .nc) stripped of ions and water and fit to first frame, which is the pre-minimization frame
RMSD's of the ligand and protein.

I use this with run_cpptraj.sh, which currently has the functionality of replacing parts of each path in each file (${1} and ${2} from the command line). You can remove this functionality if it doesn't suit you - I use this to run a bunch of different simulations at the same time. 

You can also run them manually by calling the same commands listed in the .sh submit script - in that case you just run them in order, 001 to 004.
